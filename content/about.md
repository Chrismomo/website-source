This site is my playground for testing new stuff. I have built my own theme for Hugo to get some experience with how everything works.

This site is built with:

- Hugo (http://gohugo.io)
- Sass (http://sass-lang.com)
- Bourbon/Neat/Bitters/Refills (http://bourbon.io)
- Sublime Text (http://www.sublimetext.com)

And when it comes to hosting:

- The static site are hosted on github pages
- The images are hosted by cloudinary
- Comments are hosted by Muut (https://muut.com)
- Statistics are done by Google Analytics
